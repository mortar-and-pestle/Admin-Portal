#1) Is the waterfall model a good choice for dev this system? 
    No, it would be a bad idea to implement the waterfall model to this 
    project since it is not a very flexible model. Requirements might not be
    very clear at the beggining of the project and the client might
    change his mind at any time. Waterfall does not allow for requirements 
    to change once the project has started. <-- needs fixing, add more.

#2) Is iterative dev leading to a single release of the system a good choice
    for dev this system?
    Not sure? Is this the same as incremental? 

#3) Is agile dev with releases of small increments of software a good choice for
    dev this system?
    Yes, because it is adaptive and allows for requirements to change. 

#4) Discuss first thoughts on how you will approach the sol?
    Framework? No framework? What do you think?
