#1) Is the waterfall model a good choice for dev this system? 
    No, it would be a bad idea to implement the waterfall model to this 
    project since waterfall is not a very flexible model. Requirements might not be
    very clear at the beggining of the project and the client might
    change his mind at any time. Waterfall does not allow for requirements 
    to change once the project has started which means if the requirements of
    the assignment/project change there will be the need to start from scratch
    again.

#2) Is iterative dev leading to a single release of the system a good choice
    for dev this system?
    Yes, iterative development is a good choice for the given project since it does 
    allow for changes to be made while the project is already in development.
    Iterative would allow us to work on small functionalities of the project at every
    step of the way, thereby making it easier to view/measure progress. As a result, 
    iterative is a very attractive model for the given project.

#3) Is agile dev with releases of small increments of software a good choice for
    dev this system?
    Yes, because it is adaptive and allows for requirements to change. 

#4) Discuss first thoughts on how you will approach the sol?
    Framework? No framework? What do you think?
